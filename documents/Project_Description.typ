  === End users

  End users are people economically disposed to make a journey, a travel or a journey, interested in save money but at the same time not so willing to organize every single detail. Travel agencies can ease user's responsabilities but they might be significantly expensive and so not affordable for everyone. Ultimately, end users may be young adults, in the range between 20 and 40 years old, who would like  to prepare an holiday with friends or the family, but they can be also adolescents who are approaching this type of experience for the first time.

  === Influencers

  mainly youtubers with which

  === Recommenders

  other users (friends and family members)

  === Economic buyers

  either travellers themselves or their parents (in case of teenagers)

  === Decision makers

  travellers themselves

  === Interviews

  To validate our solution hypothesis, we conducted an extensive series of interviews with our target users to thoroughly assess whether the identified problem truly exists.
  This qualitative research was aimed at gathering detailed insights and authentic feedback to ensure that our solution addresses a real and pressing need among our final users.
  Before actively starting the interview process, we thoroughly prepared by studying techniques to maximize the information extracted from our interviewees ad wrote a small interview guide with a structured list of *core* questions. Additionally, we considered recruiting participants that best represented our user personas to ensure meaningful insights. This preparation helped us understand exactly what to ask and how to create a comfortable environment conducive to honest and comprehensive responses, ultimately enhancing the quality and usefulness of the interviews.
