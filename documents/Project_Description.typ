  === End users

  End users are people economically disposed to make a journey, a travel or a journey, interested in save money but at the same time not so willing to organize every single detail. Travel agencies can ease user's responsabilities but they might be significantly expensive and so not affordable for everyone. Ultimately, end users may be young adults, in the range between 20 and 40 years old, who would like  to prepare an holiday with friends or the family, but they can be also adolescents who are approaching this type of experience for the first time.

  === Influencers

  mainly youtubers with which

  === Recommenders

  other users (friends and family members)

  === Economic buyers

  either travellers themselves or their parents (in case of teenagers)

  === Decision makers

  travellers themselves

  === Problem validation

  To validate our problem hypothesis, we conducted an extensive series of interviews with our target users to thoroughly assess whether the identified problem truly exists.
  This qualitative research was aimed at gathering detailed insights and authentic feedback to ensure that our solution addresses a real and pressing need among our final users.
  Before actively starting the interview process, we thoroughly prepared by studying techniques to maximize the information extracted from our interviewees ad wrote a small interview guide with a structured list of *core* questions. Additionally, we considered recruiting participants that best represented our user personas to ensure meaningful insights. This preparation helped us understand exactly what to ask and how to create a comfortable environment conducive to honest and comprehensive responses, ultimately enhancing the quality and usefulness of the interviews.

  #heading(level: 4, outlined: false, numbering: none)[Interviewee \#1]
  She is 22 years old, loves travelling and she has done it to several destinations including Spain, Greece, and Dublin. For her first trip, she traveled with a group of friends and chose to use a dedicated agency to quickly arrange the trip and secure the best options at a lower cost. However, they didn’t have enough time to properly organize the journey. Despite this, she expressed a preference to plan future trips independently to enjoy greater freedom and more choices beyond standard agency packages. She values advice from people who have experienced the same trip to obtain unbiased recommendations.
  On another trip, the majority of the planning was done by one friend, with support from the group. They preferred to select activities through the raccomentations that social media platforms gave to them such as YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram because was easier and less time spending. The group stayed connected and coordinated via calls and video calls during planning. However, the process took considerable time.
  She also mentioned that managing tickets and travel documents was frustrating, especially when shared among the group, as it was disorganized and scattered.
  Overall, she showed strong interest in our idea and is eager to try it for her future travel planning.
