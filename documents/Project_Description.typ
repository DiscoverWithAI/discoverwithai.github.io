  The application has the purpose of guiding the user throughout the process of setting up his or her travel, providing suggestions, comparing prices and proposing itineraries. The guideline is composed by steps, for instance the flights purchase or the accommodations booking, thus the user can easly choose the best options for his or her travel assisted by an Artifical Intelligence (AI) tool.

  == Problem analysis

  The *latent problem* the application is willing to solve is about time wasted over travels preparation. Some platforms that look for best prices of flight tickets already exists, as well as those for hotels booking. Some web sites or forums are also well focused on presenting point of interests and most popular attractions, however searching all information on your own becomes very dispersive and frustating. _Discover With AI_ aims to bundle the existing services into an all-in-one platform in order to reduce time spent on searching on internet the information needed.
