  = Application analysis

  The application has the purpose of guiding the user throughout the process of setting up his or her travel, comparing prices, providing suggestions and proposing itineraries. The guideline is composed by steps, for instance flights purchase followed by accommodations booking, thus the user can easly choose the best options for his or her travel assisted by an Artifical Intelligence (AI) tool.

  Two type of platforms are designed for fully satisfing user needs:

  - *web site* - since the majority of travellers organize their trips using a computer, because of screens size and more flexibility of browsers, a web site is provided with all features necessary for setting up the journey;

  - *web application* or *mobile application* - after completing the organization process, all information are easly consultable on mobile devices which are more often used during travels.

  The scope of the AI tool is to provide suggestions about prices, locations and transports, not to complete purchases. This action, in fact, would require partnerships with several companies of flights and accommodations booking, and public services such as public transports and museums. Therefore, links to the actual platforms for ultimating the purchases are supplied in the web site, so that the user, after completed the process, can indicate that the payment has been made. Finally, the user can check all reservations, payments and even the entire itinerary on his or her mobile device.

  == Problem analysis

  Some platforms that look for best prices of flight tickets already exists, as well as those for hotels booking. Some web sites or forums are also well focused on presenting point of interests and most popular attractions, however searching all information on your own becomes very dispersive and frustating. The *latent problem* the application is willing to solve is about inefficient preparation of travels. More in details, the problem can be charatterized in the following "sub-problems":

  - *time save* - the AI tool is able to speed up the process of searching information in internet, especially when looking for point of interests in places the traveller is unfamiliar with. Additionally it is more efficient in comparing alternatives, making the user check different options easier;

  - *money save* - the AI tool is also able to propose itineraries scheduling the trip day-by-day, providing, besides, cheaper options with regarding to traveller's budget, for instance suggesting a museum that offers discounts in particular days. This kind of treatment is also supplied by travel agencies, but costs can increase significantly;

  - *better information organization* - the web application or the mobile application have the scope of keeping all information in one read-to-use place. The goal is to facilitate the access to data of reservations, itineraries and personal notes in order to make the travel experiene easier and more enjoyable.

  _Discover With AI_ aims to bundle the existing services into an all-in-one platform in order to improve the travel experience and make this type of activity more affordable still keeping a good balance between prices and quality.
