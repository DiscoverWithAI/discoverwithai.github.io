*Q:* _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_\
*A:* It depends: having friends is more fun but making everyone get agree is very frustrating, solo travels instead are easier but some of them, like for example road trips, becomes very boaring if you are alone.

*Q:* _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_\
*A:* As I said before, the larger your travel group is, the more difficult coming to an agreement is. When I propose my ideas to others, I am often ignored because they are considered ridiculus, so now I prefer to stay aside so as not to argue, almost everything is fine to me.

*Q:* _How did you find all of the information you needed?_\
*A:* I tipically use the most famous web sites for flights and accomodations such as Sky Scanner, Booking and Airbnb. To outline a rough itinerary I search main attractions on internet, Google Maps, Instagram and sometimes I ask to some AI to suggest me what to visit, as I did for my solo trip to Istanbul. Overall I enjoy explore day-by-day and not to organize so much before the travel.

*A:* Not so much, however deciding flights and accomodations takes the majority of the time.

*Q:* _How did you organize the journey?_\
*A:* When I travel in group I prefer not ot activate so much because of what I already said, even if I follow the organization process. Instad, when I travel alone, I firstly buy flights tickets, then a cheap accomodation like hostels and eventually I decide more or less what to visit.

*Q:* _How much time did it take?_\
*A:* Not so much time, I think a few weeks. Of course when I travel with friends the time spent on finding best options increases significantly.

*Q:* _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_\
*A:* Yes, quite satisfied, I have low expectations so, until now, information I found on internet and social networks helped me, as well as chat bots.
