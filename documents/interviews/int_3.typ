*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Yes, I have. The first time I traveled was when I went to Brazil: I was very young, only 3 years old, but I still manage to remember those moments. After several years I then flew to Washington. Finally, when I started high school I studied 6 months in South Africa and then I did several travels both on my own or with some friends of mine.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* It depends: traveling with friends is way funnier but making everyone to agree on something is a very frustrating task most of the time. Solo travels are indeed easier to organize, but some of them, like road trips for example, become very boring if you're alone, without anyone to share a beer with.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* As I said before, the larger your travel group is, the harder coming to an agreement. Unfortunately, when I propose my ideas to others, I often end with being ignored because they're considered ridiculous for reasons I'm still not really able to understand, therefore I now prefer to step aside and remain quit as the other organize the journey to prevent arguing: almost everything is fine to me after all..

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* I typically use well-known web sites for flights and accommodations such as Sky Scanner, Booking and Airbnb. To outline a rough itinerary I search main attractions on the internet, Google Maps, Instagram and sometimes I ask some AI for suggestions about place to visit, as I did for my solo trip to Istanbul for example. Overall, I really enjoy exploring day-by-day without a meticulous organization done before the travel itself.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* Honestly, not so much, however choosing flights and accommodations took the majority of the time spent.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* When I travel in group I prefer to not intervene in the organization so much because of what I previously said, although I still follow the whole process. Instead, when I travel alone, I firstly buy flights tickets, then I book a cheap accommodation like youth hostels and finally I start to decide more or less what to visit: as I mentioned, I like to improvise.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* Not so much time as someone could think actually, I think a few weeks in total. Of course, when I travel with friends the time spent on finding what the best options are significantly increases.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Yes, quite satisfied: it could be because I don't really have high expectations so, until now, information I found on the internet and social networks helped me in the right measure, as well as chat bots.
Actually I’d really like to have a way to track where I’ve been and maintain a detailed history of my routes and the places I’ve visited, much like how Strava records activities. This would make it simple for me to share my entire journey or itinerary with anyone who asks, allowing them to see exactly where I’ve gone and what I’ve done without any hassle. Having this kind of organized record would be incredibly useful for keeping memories or planning future trips.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_* \
Well, yes, fairly easy: in one hand because we didn't have a lot of documents, because I like to improvise for the most part. In the other hand, my friends always setup a shared Google Drive folder, so we can find all of what we need there.
