*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Yes, I did. In fact, it was very similar to when my children were young because I wanted to give them the opportunity to explore the world, experience different cultures, and perhaps ignite a passion for travel within them that would grow as they got older.
As for now, I don’t travel as often because I’m getting older and the costs have increased significantly. As a result, I usually only travel once every two or three years.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* I have traveled solo only once in my life, and I didn’t really enjoy the experience. For that reason, I would definitely say that I prefer to travel in a group or with my family. Traveling together allows everyone to suggest places they want to visit, making it much easier to create a well-rounded and enjoyable itinerary that suits everyone’s interests.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Well, when I travel with my family, I’m usually the only one responsible for creating some kind of itinerary because the others tend to get bored when it comes to researching places to visit. I don’t mind taking on that role, but if I didn’t do it, then no one else would step up to plan the trip.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* I mainly search for places to visit and accommodations on Google, but I also often ask my friends or colleagues for recommendations or tips. Their personal experiences usually help me discover hidden gems or popular spots that I might otherwise overlook.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:*  Well, yes, but not in the sense that I couldn’t find any information. I get bored quite easily, so I usually create a rough idea of an itinerary just to have a basic framework to follow during the trip. This way, I can stay organized without feeling overwhelmed by too many details.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* Typically, I suggest a destination to my family, and they provide feedback along with suggestions of places they would like to visit. After that, I start searching for flights or other ways to get there, as well as hotels to stay in. Finally, I create an itinerary based on my family’s suggestions combined with the information I find through online research.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* Honestly, I’m not exactly sure. Usually, after about two hours of searching for information, I start to feel bored and lose interest, so I tend to stop and leave the planning as it is at that point.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Not really that much. Every time, I tend to create an itinerary day by day, but this often ends up wasting a lot of time that could have been better spent exploring other places we might not have even known existed.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* If I only have the documents for the hotel reservation, then yes, I usually keep everything organized. However, when I need to book other things like museum tickets or entrance to attractions, it becomes a real hassle. I end up with documents scattered all over the place, and every time I need to access them, I have to download them again on my phone, which can be a huge waste of time.
