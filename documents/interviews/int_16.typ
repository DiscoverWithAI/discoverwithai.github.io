*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Yes, a lot actually, mostly when I was very young with my parents. Getting older, I lost the will to travel because it is very costly and requires a lot of effort and organization especially when traveling in group.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* Even though I said that traveling in group is more difficult since requires a better organization, I would say that it is way more fun and exciting traveling that way.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Well, I’m not the type of guy that takes the initiative because I’m not that good at organizing itineraries, so I tend to let the others do it. Of course, if they ask me about some places that I would like to visit or want suggestions, I will tell them about it.

*Q: _How did your group find all of the information needed?_*\
*A:* I can’t say exactly, but I guess they mainly use google and social network. The thing I can confirm for sure is that back then, my parents and I would go to some specialized agency so they could make us the perfect itinerary. I remember that was very costly, so I don’t think people want to get in touch with them anymore. Another way we used to plan was by reading vacation magazines, but like searching things on Google nowadays, it was a mess—too many good reviews on too many places.

*Q: _How did your group organize the journey?_*\
*A:*  The last time I went to Germany with my friends, and they did all the heavy work. We initially met up to make a list of things we wanted to visit, to get a general idea of what we wanted to do. Then they booked flights and everything and made an itinerary for all of us to follow. That way, we optimized our time and visited a lot of places.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* For them, I think it took almost three weeks for a short journey of eight days: it seems way too much to me.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what they organized?_*\
*A:* Absolutely yes, the trip I just mentioned was the best I’ve ever had in my life, I think. We visited all the places we wanted to visit and much more—it was perfect.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* Well, I didn’t have to do it myself because they emailed us all the necessary tickets and passes they had booked for us. If I were in their position, I would say it was quite a hassle, yes.
