*A:* Of course, I love traveling and have done so several times. I have visited several beautiful places in Spain and Greece, and one of my favorite destinations is Greece more precisely Zante, which left a lasting impression on me.

*Q:* _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_\
*A:* My first trip was with a group of friends, and we went to Zante. We consulted a dedicated travel agency to get a rough idea of the entire trip, which helped us plan everything smoothly. It was a lot of fun, and since I had never traveled alone before, I currently prefer traveling with a group. However, I hope to experience solo travel in the future to discover new perspectives and challenges.

*Q:* _Why did you ask an agency to help?_\
*A:* Mainly, we wanted to secure the best options at a lower cost. Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough time to organize the journey properly, so we had to make quick decisions to fit everything into our schedule.

*Q:* _Where you satisfied?_\
*A:* Not that much. I would prefer to organize the journey myself because it allows me greater freedom and more choices beyond the standard agency packages. However, I might ask for advice from people who have experienced the same trip to obtain unbiased and more personalized recommendations. This way, I can tailor the experience to my preferences while benefiting from others’ insights.

*Q:* _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_\
*A:* Yes, I do enjoy planning trips, but if someone else in my group is more willing to take the lead, I usually let them do it while definitely offering my help. The last time I traveled, a friend of mine took charge of organizing, but I was actively involved as well. I kept suggesting places to visit and sharing valuable information that I found scattered across the internet to enhance our experience.

*Q:* _How did you find all of the information you need?_\
*A:* I mainly find information and interesting places to visit on social networks like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. I follow many influencers who specialize in travel content, which helps me discover unique destinations and insider tips that might not be as widely known.

*Q:* _How much time did it took?_\
*A:* To organize the last journey, it took about a month. However, we were all apart from each other, so staying connected and coordinating through calls and video calls slowed us down. Despite that, we didn’t have much trouble researching information, thanks to social networks and my friend, who is good at planning and genuinely enjoys doing it.
#v(10pt)
*Q:* _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_\
*A:* Well, my first journey, which was entirely organized by a travel agency, as I mentioned earlier, I didn’t enjoy that much. However, for the one that we organized ourselves, I would definitely say yes—I enjoyed it much more. We could have improved by creating a more organized schedule to follow, but I didn’t mind the flexibility we had during the trip.

*Q:* _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_\
*A:* No, it was frustrating, especially when shared among the group, because it was disorganized and scattered. I wish there were a better way to keep all the documents in one place without relying on cloud services or constantly moving files around. Having a more streamlined and centralized system would definitely make the process much easier and more efficient.
