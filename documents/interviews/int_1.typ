 *Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
 *A:* My first trip was with a group of friends, and we went to Zante. We consulted a dedicated travel agency to get a rough idea of the entire trip, which helped us plan everything smoothly. It was a lot of fun, and since I had never travelled alone before, I currently prefer travelling with a group. However, I hope to experience solo travel in the future to discover new perspectives and challenges.

 *Q: _Why did you ask an agency to help?_*\
 *A:* Mainly, we wanted to secure the best options at a lower cost. Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough time to organize the journey properly, so we had to make quick decisions to fit everything into our schedule.

 *Q: _Were you satisfied?_*\
 *A:* Not that much. I prefer to organize the journey myself because it gives me greater freedom and more options beyond the standard packages offered by travel agencies. With that said, I often seek advice from people who have experienced the same trip to gain unbiased and more personalized recommendations. This approach allows me to tailor the trip to my own preferences while benefiting from the valuable insights and firsthand experiences of others, making the overall journey more rewarding and unique.

 *Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
 *A:* Yes, I do enjoy planning trips, but if someone else in my group is more willing to take the lead, I usually let them handle the main organization while definitely offering my support and assistance. The last time I travelled, a friend of mine took charge of organizing the trip, yet I remained actively involved throughout the process. I continuously suggested interesting places to visit and shared valuable information that I had found scattered across the internet. My contributions helped enhance our overall experience and ensured we made the most out of our journey.

 *Q: _How did you find all of the information you need?_*\
 *A:* I mainly found information and interesting places to visit on social networks like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. I follow many influencers who are specialized in travel content, which helps me discover unique destinations and insider tips that might not be as widely known.

 *Q: _How much time did it took?_*\
 *A:* Organizing the last journey took us about a month. Since we were all in different locations, staying connected and coordinating through calls and video chats often slowed down the process. Despite this challenge, we didn’t face much difficulty researching information because social networks provided a wealth of useful advice and tips. Additionally, my friend, who is skilled at planning and genuinely enjoys organizing trips, played a crucial role in keeping everything on track. Her enthusiasm and expertise made the experience much smoother and more enjoyable for all of us.

 *Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
 *A:* Well, my first journey, which was entirely organized by a travel agency, as I mentioned earlier, I didn’t enjoy that much. However, for the one that we organized ourselves, I would definitely say yes—I enjoyed it much more. We could have improved by creating a more organized schedule to follow, but I didn’t mind the flexibility we had during the trip.

 *Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
 *A:* It was quite frustrating, especially because the documents and information were shared among the group in a very disorganized and scattered way. This made it difficult for everyone to stay on the same page and caused unnecessary confusion and delays. I really wish there was a better solution to keep all the travel documents—like itineraries, tickets, and important details—in one secure and easily accessible place without having to rely heavily on cloud services or constantly moving files back and forth between devices. This would save time and reduce stress, making group travel planning a much smoother and more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.
