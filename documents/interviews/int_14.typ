*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Well, not that often, but yes, I do travel more now than before. To be honest, it’s mainly because I have more financial resources and greater free time available throughout the year, which allows me to take more trips and explore new places.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* I have tried traveling solo once, but I got bored almost immediately. Traveling in a group is much more enjoyable because you can share the experience and participate in more engaging activities together. For now, I tend to travel only with my family, as it feels more comfortable and fun.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Yes, quite a lot, actually. I really enjoy creating itineraries and often like to surprise the people traveling with me. I put a lot of effort into planning each trip, and I frequently receive compliments about the journeys I organize. It feels rewarding to see everyone having a great time thanks to the planning I do.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* I usually start my search on Google, but I rely even more on social networks like Facebook and Instagram. I follow many travel influencers who explore destinations all over the world, and through their posts, I often discover a lot of exciting and unique places to visit. Their recommendations really inspire my travel plans.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* The searching part isn’t the most difficult for me. I would say the real challenge is gathering all the information and organizing it into a coherent itinerary. I’m not very skilled at organizing details, so I end up wasting a lot of time trying to put everything together. It’s also difficult for me to fit all the places I want to visit into the limited time I have available during the trip.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:*  Well, first I search for interesting places to visit on the internet and write them all down. Then, I try to create an itinerary that fits as many of those places as possible within the time frame I have available for the trip.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* I usually spend about two days searching for interesting places and then around a week trying to piece together the itinerary. Like I mentioned before, I don’t mind doing this, but sometimes I wish I could speed up the process and not spend one or two whole weeks planning the trip.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Most of the time, yes, I feel satisfied, but I always have the sense that I could further optimize the itinerary to include one or two more places to visit. It’s a constant challenge to balance everything perfectly.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* I can’t say it was easy, but it wasn’t impossible either. It was definitely another time-consuming task, but to be honest, I’ve never really complained much about it. I’ve never been particularly mindful or bothered by the time it takes.
