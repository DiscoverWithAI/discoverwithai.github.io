*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* I don't think taking some days for yourself, even for doing a small solo trip, would be a bad experience, but I definitely prefer to travel in group with my family: we always have a lot of fun together and we make our relation stronger each time.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Yes, definitely: I love to organize thing even in the smallest details. Not only because it's cheaper than taking those pre-paid travel boxes or paying a travel agency fee, but also because you can find really good deals if you keep digging the Web, for example by booking certain hotels sometimes you get special discounts for attractions. Also, I can set up the journey considering the interests of each one of my family member, and that's something you can do easily only if you organize by yourself.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* Nowadays I mainly use the Internet and specialized services that allow you to compare several different prices among different booking services. I also heavily rely on social networks to check if there are some particular places that many people don't visit but are actually really great, especially for taking a good old family picture. \
Furthermore, I bought several books during the years about travel destinations in which there are really a lot of tips and nice travel suggestions.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* Not really, with the increasing diffusion of the Internet searching information became easier than ever. Nowadays the situation has gotten a little worse because websites are sometimes filled up with advertisements, but it's nothing a good ad-blocker cannot solve. \ 
Also sometimes I use chatGPT a little bit but I don't really trust it much because it gave me unreliable result in the past.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* First I decide with my family where to go and agree on a common destination, after that my husband and my children start finding some interesting places to visit. When they are done, I start searching for accommodations and the various tickets: it's a little tricky sometimes because the usual services don't want to give you the best price, but with a little bit of patience it's a problem that it's easily solvable.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* Overall not much, mainly because we organize everything several weeks, sometimes month, before the departure, although this is more for getting cheaper prices, the research itself it's neither difficult nor cost a lot of time.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
