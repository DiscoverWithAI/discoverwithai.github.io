*Q: _Have you ever traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Yes a lot: I visited a huge number of places with my family since I was really young, even outside Europe. When I grow up a bit I started to travel with my friends: usually we don't go very far, destinations are often seas and mountains near our places.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* I've never traveled alone. However, when I'm with my family, I always struggle to find something I could find interesting to visit because I really don't like visiting museums, monuments and art galleries as my dad and my brother do. I instead prefer to walk around cities and take my time, without rushing.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* When I travel with my family I typically buy flights tickets and book the accommodation with my brother, after that I let him and my dad choose what to visit. On the other hand, when I travel with my friends, I always collaborate with them in order to minimize the required effort.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* I always use Google Maps so I can easily see what and where point of interests are, especially when I'm planning to go to places in mountains that are not well-known. Moreover, I often surf the internet, in particular YouTube and various social networks (on Reddit, for example, I always find very nice suggestions). Sometimes I ask ChatGPT what the most popular spots for spending some time with my friends are, like pubs and discos for example, when I go with them to seaside resorts.

*A:* Not so much, there are many resources from which it's possible to take information and after so many travels I can say I acquired a certain skill in selecting the most interesting.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* Firstly I search and buy flights tickets using services like Sky Scanner, then, without haste, I book accommodations and, if necessary, other services like ferries or rental cars. Me and my friends usually like to decide the day before what to see the next day, so we only roughly outline the trip.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* Not so much time, honestly only a few hours to buy flights tickets, then some days to rent a house. I would say one or two weeks in total.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Yes, quite satisfied, internet is a good source from which find what you are looking for.
