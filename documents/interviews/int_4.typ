*Q:* _Have you ever traveled in the past?_\
*A:* Yes a lot, since I was young with my family, even outside Europe. Instead, when I travel with my friends, destinations are often seas and mountains, not so far from home.

*Q:* _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_\
*A:* I have never traveled alone. However when I am with my family I always strugle to find something interesting because I really do not like visiting museums, monuments and art galleries as my dad and my brother do. I instead prefer to walk around the city and take it more calmly.

*Q:* _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_\
*A:* When I travel with my family I tipically take flights tickets and the accomodation with my brother, after that I let him and my dad choose what to visit. Instead, when I travel with my friends, I always collaborate with them in order to minimize the effort.

*Q:* _How did you find all of the information you needed?_\
*A:* I always use Google Maps so I can easier see where point of interests are, specially when I go to not so visited places in mountains. Moreover I often consult internet (on Reddit I always find very nice suggestions), YouTube and social networks. Sometimes I ask ChatGPT which are most attractive locals like pubs and discos when I go to beaches with friends.

*Q:* _How did you organize the journey?_\
*A:* Firstly I buy flights tickets using Sky Scanner, then, calmly, I book accomodations and, if necessary, other services like ferries or rental cars. Me and my friends usually like to decide the day before what to see the next day, so we only roughly outline the trip.
