*Q: _Have you ever traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Yes, I have traveled many times, actually. Since my third birthday, my parents have taken me with them on their annual summer vacations. I visited many places during these trips. Of course, I don't remember all of them because I was too young for some, but I clearly recall visiting Spain about four different times, each time in a different city. I also traveled to Portugal and Cuba several times, especially Cuba, which I went to around five times since it is where my mom was born. Besides that, I have been to some places in Italy, like Sardegna, once in Greece, and a few times in Austria and Croatia. I stopped traveling with my parents when I turned eighteen because I got bored of going on trips with them.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* Well, I have never traveled alone, so I would say that I prefer to travel in a group. Right now, I would really love to go on trips with my friends, but unfortunately, we all have different duties and plans. Also, we don’t have much money at the moment, so traveling together is difficult for us.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* I would say that I will definitely try to help make some kind of itinerary, but I don’t really enjoy doing it. It can be difficult to find all the information because it is spread across many websites on the internet. Choosing the right information takes a lot of time. Sometimes, there might not even be a good website, so I have to call to get the details I need. But what if the country speaks a language I don’t know? That makes everything even more complicated. Honestly, planning trips like this can be a real mess.

*Q: _Can you give me an example where you help to make one?\*_*\
*A:* There was one summer when I created a complete two-week itinerary for my parents and me to visit Portugal. To be honest, it was actually a school assignment for the summer. That said, I didn’t enjoy doing it at all. As I mentioned before, I was doing it alone and didn’t know where to find all the information. Because of that, I ended up making the most basic and simple itinerary possible, without much detail or excitement.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* I mainly used Google to search for information and nothing else. At the time, I was about twelve years old and didn’t have access to social networks or other online platforms like that. So, my options for finding travel details were very limited.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* It took me about a month or so to complete the itinerary. The whole process was really painful, and I honestly hated doing it. I wish there was a tool that could quickly suggest things to do and places to visit without me having to search for everything by hand. That would have made planning so much easier and less frustrating.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Considering that I spent a whole month just to create the most basic itinerary ever, I would say no.

*Q: _How did your parents organize the journey?_*\
*A:* I’m not sure exactly, but I think my dad, who is always in charge of booking hotels, flights, and other travel arrangements, has never made an itinerary either. He’s not a big fan of spending too much time searching for information online. He gets bored very quickly and usually gives up fast.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* As I said before, the task of booking everything was my father’s responsibility. I have seen him get very frustrated sometimes because the tickets and bookings were all over the place. Some tickets required logging back into the website where he bought them, while others were sent by email or stored in different apps. This made managing everything confusing and stressful for him.
