*Q:* _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_\
*A:* I think the perfet number of traelers is 2: if you choose the right mate you have good company but it is also much more easy get agree on where to go, what to visit and so on. Travellig in solo allows for more freedom of choises but you get tired faster.

*Q:* _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_\
*A:* Yes, since I always travel with only few other friends, all of us try to participate on the organization, mee too. However, I use to search only main information about the place we will visit, I prefer live the moment.

*Q:* _How did you find all of the information you needed?_\
*A:* I mainly use the usual sites for buying flights tickets and booking accommodations, then I navigate on internet and Google Maps to looking for some point of interests that I do not want to miss. Moreover, if it is possible, I try to listen to someone who already visited the place.

*Q:* _Was searching information difficult?_\
*A:* Not so much, in general there are many more attractions than the time you have to visit them, so searching for something you are interested into is relatively easy for me.

*Q:* _How did you organize the journey?_\
*A:* Tipically I or my friends launch the idea, if we like it enough we decide the dates and buy flights or train tickets, then we book the apartment and we almost stop the preparation phase, we often have a vague program. If some attractions must be booked, for example the Louvre museum (in the case when I flew to Paris), we reserve them.

*Q:* _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_\
