*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Yes, I do, I travel at least once per year. For example, I flew to Spain to meet one of my friends in Barcelona and the following year I came back to visit part of the south. My last travels were to Morocco and France, Paris to be precise, with my best friend Nicolò.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* I think the perfect number of travelers is 2: if you choose the right mate you'll surely have good company but it's also extremely easier to all agree on where to go, what to visit and so on. Solo traveling allows for more freedom of choices but you get tired faster.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Yes, since I always travel with only few other friends, all of us try to participate on the organization, and that includes me obviously. However, I usually search only general information about places we would like to visit: in other words, I prefer to live the moment.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* I mainly use well-known websites for buying flights tickets and booking accommodations, then I surf the web and use Google Maps in order to find some points of interest that I don't want to miss. Moreover, I try to ask some more information to someone who already visited the place, but it's not always possible, unfortunately.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* Not so much, in general there are many more attractions than the time you have to visit the place, so searching for something you're interested into is relatively easy for me.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* Typically, I or my friends suggest an idea, if we like it enough we decide the dates and buy flights or train tickets, then we book an apartment and our preliminary preparation usually stop there, we often have a vague program as I mentioned before. If some attractions must be booked, for example the Louvre museum (in the case when I flew to Paris), then we obviously reserve them.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* Honestly I think a few days only, a week or two at most.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Yes, pretty satisfied. As I said before, I always find something to visit or simply some nice places to walk around, no matter the initial preparation phase.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_* \
As I mentioned before, I don't think having a very large group is good for a trip, so there are not so many documents. Usually I keep all of my information in the phone notes, I never had large troubles by doing that.
