*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* In the past not so much honestly, especially when I was younger I didn't have the necessary resources in order to travel, with some little exception like the near cities. On the other hand, over the last few years I've started to travel more, especially because I found a more flexible and profitable job. Just to give an example, last year I did a 1-week holiday in London with my wife.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* I like to travel in group, specifically with my family: I honestly don't really like traveling in solo, it's a little bit boring in my opinion. I mean, it's perfectly fine to spend some time alone, even with a small trip, but with long vacations solo-traveling would mean no one to talk to, anybody to share your opinion with. Additionally, holidays are perfect opportunities to strengthen your personal relation with your family, opportunities you will not have forever.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Well, yes and no. I really enjoy to organize family holidays all by myself but unfortunately it requires a lot of time: searching information on the Internet it's something really hard, especially if you want to do an accurate job and find out the best deals for hotel rooms, transport and attractions' tickets. Self-organization translates in the most flexible way to organize a journey but there is really a lot to keep track of and very little time to do it.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* In general, after with my family I decide what to visit, I fire up my pc and search information about popular places to visit, at the same time filtering out paid-to-write articles and similar. Next I look for suggestions on social networks groups to confirm what I found is actually something valuable to visit. After that, I proceed to find on google maps the best accommodations in terms of distance from attraction and/or public transports. Finally, I use specialized booking website to find the best deal, but I also check in the hotels' websites: sometimes they actually have a better price there!

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* As I mentioned before, yes: actually, my children are really quick when talking about searching information, but for me is another story. Every time there are a lot of pop-ups, advertisements and so on and so forth, I think I lose a lot of time for that reason alone. Also, sometimes I spend days only to find the perfect promotion, only for then discovering that a better promotion was available if using a different booking service: it's really a mess.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* Typically my wife and I understand where we are both on vacation and then we check also if our children have school or not. After that, we check together some possible places and some possible point of interest. Finally I do all of the research I told you about before.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* Well, it depends on the length of the holiday, can be some weeks or a month really, also considering the Internet situation.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Not completely satisfied: I mean, I'm not saying I didn't like what I organized, but using the Internet is not quite easy for me as you could understand, so I know I could do better.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* That's another problematic topic: every time I do booking I receive several emails, some of which are just confirmations and not the booking itself. I usually resort in printing all of the email with the actual booking so I have all the documents in my hand and I don't need to search between the various emails every time.
