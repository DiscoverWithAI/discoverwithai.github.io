*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:*  Yes, quite a bit, especially when I was younger, now I tend to travel a little bit less because of my work, but during vacation I still do the possible in order to go somewhere that is not my house. Apart from that, I visited both national and international places, visiting Rome, Genoa, Bologna, Trieste, Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Warsaw and Athens. Recently I decided to go to China for a week: as you can understand Asia was generally missing from my visited destinations.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* Honestly, I don't mind traveling alone, but I have to be honest: I usually go to a travel agency in order to organize my holiday and all of the travels are in group. Even when I was younger, the majority of the travels I did was with my family. Only in Rome and Vienna I managed to organize all by myself and I think I did a good organization. \ 
One thing I especially like of solo-traveling is the fact that you don't need to wait for anyone and you can take all of the time you want, so you can really live the place you currently at.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Well, you can definitely say so: I love to organize my travel, especially because you can setup the thing exactly the way you want, but, unfortunately, it's quite time consuming. Back when I was younger I used to do that, a little bit at least, with some of my family travel but now I have to mainly resort on travel agencies because it's the only way I can manage to leave as soon as the vacation starts, even if this means spending a lot more money and not taking the cheaper solution.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* Well, back when I was young Internet was still something new, especially in Italy, so information were found by looking into specialized travel books. Fortunately a family friend traveled a lot in the past: every time he was a fundamental source of information. \
When Internet started to really be a thing I remember searching for advices into facebook groups and myspace, but very little: I still relied on books, which I used to buy in a local book shops. \
Obviously, nowadays the situation is completely different and Internet is my main source of information, although, as I said, I never end up with a complete journey because of time-related problems.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* Yes, absolutely, searching between books and try to understand if what was written was really the author's honest opinion was really a mess. Also, for getting precise information, because time table on books would have been easily outdated, the only way was calling, and obviously that would be a potential language barrier and a salty phone bill. \
I must be honest, with the Internet the situation is not really better: while it's true that finding updated information is a lot easier, finding honest opinions and the true, cheapest option without some hidden fees written in a corner of a banner is a mess.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* In the past, after the long and extensive research I started calling for asking some additional information, room availability of hotels and, finally, book the room. Nowadays I would simply book all of the things online but, as I mentioned before, I pay organized trips with travel agencies, so they actually take care of everything.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* A lot, about a month or two. With Internet the situation is a little bit better but still not enough.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* For the most part yes, especially considering the past limited resources. The two travel I organized by myself I am particularly proud of them and I would be really curious of what I could do with today's Internet, but I am quietly certain it would be still a mess.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* No, at all, a lot of paper and documents, too much in my opinion. Nowadays you can use apps but still, every booking service has its app with some part of the information: nothing changed, only the media, from physical to digital.
